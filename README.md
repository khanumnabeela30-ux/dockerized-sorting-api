# dockerized-sorting-api
A Dockerized Python FastAPI application implementing Bubble Sort as a REST API.

# Dockerized Sorting API (Python)

## Overview
This project is a simple backend application built using Python.  
It implements a basic Data Structures and Algorithms concept (Bubble Sort) and exposes it as a REST API.

The goal of this project is to understand:
- How an algorithm can be converted into an API
- How Docker helps in running applications consistently
- How APIs can be tested remotely using tools like ngrok

---

## What is this project about?
The application accepts a list of numbers as input and returns the sorted list as output.
The sorting logic used in this project is **Bubble Sort**.

Instead of running the algorithm directly in a program, it is exposed as a **web API** so that it can be accessed from a browser or any client.

---

## What is an API?
API stands for **Application Programming Interface**.

In simple words:
- An API is a way for one program to talk to another program
- Instead of clicking buttons, we send data and get results
- Here, we send numbers to the API and get sorted numbers back

This project uses a **REST API**, which means:
- It works over HTTP (just like websites)
- It uses URLs and standard methods like POST
- It sends and receives data in JSON format

---

## Why FastAPI?
FastAPI is a Python framework used to build APIs.

It was chosen because:
- It is simple and beginner-friendly
- It automatically creates API documentation
- It is fast and commonly used in real projects

The `/docs` page is automatically generated by FastAPI and is used to test the API.

## Why Docker was used?
Docker is a tool that packages an application along with everything it needs to run.

In simple words:
- Docker makes sure the application runs the same on every system
- It avoids problems like “it works on my laptop but not on another system”
- Anyone with Docker can run this project without installing Python or libraries manually

In this project:
- The Python application is converted into a Docker image
- The image is run as a container
- The container exposes the API on port 8000

This makes the application portable and easy to run.

## Why ngrok was used?
Normally, applications running on a laptop can only be accessed on that same laptop.

ngrok was used because:
- It creates a temporary public URL
- It allows other people to access the application from anywhere
- It is useful for testing and demonstrations

In this project:
- The Docker application runs locally
- ngrok creates a secure tunnel to the local application
- A public URL is generated so the API can be tested remotely

This was especially useful for evaluation purposes.
